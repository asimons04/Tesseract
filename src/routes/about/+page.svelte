    <p class="my-3">
        <strong>Tesseract</strong> is a Lemmy client designed for media-rich content and aims to provide a comparable experience to 
        the alien site.  The reason it exists is because I wanted to fix a lot of things about Lemmy that annoyed me.  Of all the third
        party frontends out there, Photon was the closest but wasn't quite what I wanted.  So, Tesseract was forked and took on a new
        life of its own.
    </p>

   
       
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold leading-8 ">Features Unique to Tesseract</h2>
    <p class="my-3">
        I think Photon has adopted some of these, at least YouTube, but I'm unsure if any of the others are supported.  As far as I know, most of these
        are still unique to Tesseract.

            <p class="font-bold">Image/Media Proxying and Caching</p>
            <p>
                Privacy conscious users have long requested media be proxied through Lemmy.  
                While I can't add that to the API, I can add it to the UI.  Additionally, since the 
                media is already flowing through Tesseract, it made sense to optionally cache the 
                proxied media for re-use.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-4">
                <li>Enhance user privacy, reduce bandwidth to other instances, and speed up serving content to your users.</li>
                <li>Can cache any media proxied through it.  Tesseract can act as a caching proxy for your instance as well as cache media originating on other instances as well as outside resources (Giphy, Catbox, Imgur, Yarn, etc).</li>
                <li>Administrators must explicitly enable this module, and users must enable media proxying in their app settings.</li>
                <li>Acts like a CDN in a box. You can even set up regional instances of Tesseract to move the heavy data closer to your users.</li>

            <p>
                Posts with URLs can have a MBFC badge in the corner which will lookup the publisher in the MBFC database and return their bias and credibility information.  
                The MBFC results are also integrated into the reporting and moderation tools.

            <p class="font-bold">Distinguished and Sticky Comments</p>
            <p>
                This no longer works on 0.19.x versions of Lemmy because the Lemmy developers are awful and short-sighted. They weren't even using the distinguished
                flag and still decided to make it so that admins/mods could only distinguish their own comments.  Screw the Lemmy devs.  Eventually this feature
                will be removed once 0.18.x support is dropped.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Mods/Admins can distinguish and sticky comments.  Comments that are distinguished will always display at the top of the comment list 
                regardless of sort order.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that the way distinguished comments are handled only applies to Tesseract.  The comments will be marked as distinguished at the API 
                level, but it's up to individual clients/UIs to handle how to render comments with the distinguished flag set.
            </p>

            using Lemmy as a news aggregator.  Through their efforts, Tesseract is able to show credibility badges on news posts to help combat disinformation. I cannot
            thank them enough for their work.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold leading-8">Donations</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
        I built Tesseract in my spare time as a hobby, learning excercise for SvelteKit, and to address my own personal annoyances with Lemmy and other
        Lemmy UIs.  That said, I do not feel the need to accept donations for its development.
    </p>

    <p class="my-2">However, if you really want to donate, please consider donating to one of the following:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-4 my-3 text-base">

            They are the author of Photon from which Tesseract was forked who also did a lot of the heavy lifting for much of the core.  While I've replaced a lot of it, none of my work would
            have been possible without theirs.
        </li>

                Tesseract embeds a subset of a dump of their dataset in itself in order to provide the bias and credibility badges and reports. This dump comes from their browser extension.  Without this,
                it would be impossible to have this feature.  MBFC is 100% independent and relies on memberships and donations to do their work. Please consider donating to them so they can continue
                the amazing work they do.
